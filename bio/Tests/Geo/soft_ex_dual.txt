This triple fusion (TF) reporter gene fragment (3.3 kbp) was released from the plasmid with Not1 and BamH1 restriction enzymes before blunt-end ligation into the multiple cloning site of lentiviral transfer vector, FUG, driven by the human ubiquitin-C promoter. Self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus was prepared by transient transfection of 293T cells. Briefly, pFUG-TF containing the triple fusion reporter gene was co-transfected into 293T cells with HIV-1 packaging vector (?8.9) and vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein-pseudotyped envelop vector (pVSVG). Lentivirus supernatant was concentrated by sediment centrifugation using a SW29 rotor at 50,000 x g for two hours. Concentrated virus was titered on 293T cells.
