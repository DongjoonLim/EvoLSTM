RJR REBASE Enz 2540 - I-CreII-CreI
                  Homing endonuclease 


            NOTE: Homing endonucleases do not really have recognition sequences 
            in the way that restriction enzymes do. The recognition sequence 
            listed is one site that is known to be recognized and cleaved. In 
            general, single base changes merely change the efficiency of 
            cleavage and the precise boundary of required bases is not known.
