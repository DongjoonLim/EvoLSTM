* N-glycosylation site *
************************

It has been known for a long time [1] that potential N-glycosylation sites are
specific to the consensus sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr.  It must be noted that the
presence of the consensus  tripeptide  is  not sufficient  to conclude that an
asparagine residue is glycosylated, due to  the fact that the  folding of  the
protein plays an important  role in the  regulation of N-glycosylation [2]. It
has been shown [3] that  the  presence of proline between Asn and Ser/Thr will
inhibit N-glycosylation; this  has  been confirmed by a recent [4] statistical
analysis of glycosylation sites, which also  shows that about 50% of the sites
that have a proline C-terminal to Ser/Thr are not glycosylated.

It must also  be noted that there  are  a few  reported cases of glycosylation
sites with the pattern Asn-Xaa-Cys; an  experimentally demonstrated occurrence
of such a non-standard site is found in the plasma protein C [5].

-Consensus pattern: N-{P}-[ST]-{P}

* cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site *
****************************************************************

There has been a  number of studies  relative to the  specificity of cAMP- and
cGMP-dependent protein kinases [1,2,3].  Both types of kinases appear to share
a preference  for  the  phosphorylation  of serine or threonine residues found
close to at least  two consecutive N-terminal  basic residues. It is important
to note that there are quite a number of exceptions to this rule.

******************************************
* Bacteriocin class IIa family signature *
******************************************

Many Gram-positive  bacteria  produce  ribosomally  synthesized  antimicrobial
peptides, often  termed  bacteriocins. One important and well studied class of
bacteriocins is the class IIa or pediocin-like bacteriocins produced by lactic
acid bacteria.  All  class  IIa  bacteriocins  are produced by food-associated
strains, isolated  from  a  variety of food products of industrial and natural
origins, including  meat  products,  dairy  products and vegetables. Class IIa
bacteriocins are all cationic, display anti-Listeria activity, and kill target
cells by permeabilizing the cell membrane [1-3].

Class IIa  bacteriocins  contain  between  37  and 48 residues. Based on their
primary structures,  the  peptide  chains  of  class  IIa  bacteriocins may be
divided roughly into two regions: a hydrophilic, cationic and highly conserved
N-terminal region,  and  a  less  conserved hydrophobic/amphiphilic C-terminal
region. The  N-terminal  region  contains  the conserved Y-G-N-G-V/L 'pediocin
box' motif  and  two conserved cysteine residues joined by a disulfide bridge.
It forms  a  three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet supported by the conserved
disulfide bridge  (see <PDB:1OG7>). This cationic N-terminal beta-sheet domain
mediates binding of the class IIa bacteriocin to the target cell membrane. The
C-terminal region forms a hairpin-like domain (see <PDB:1OG7>) that penetrates
into the  hydrophobic  part  of  the  target  cell membrane, thereby mediating
leakage through  the  membrane.  The  two domains are joined by a hinge, which
enables movement of the domains relative to each other [2,3].

Some proteins  known  to belong to the class IIa bacteriocin family are listed
below:

 - Pediococcus acidilactici pediocin PA-1.
 - Leuconostoc mesenteroides mesentericin Y105.
 - Carnobacterium piscicola carnobacteriocin B2.
 - Lactobacillus sake sakacin P.
 - Enterococcus faecium enterocin A.
 - Enterococcus faecium enterocin P.
 - Leuconostoc gelidum leucocin A.
 - Lactobacillus curvatus curvacin A.
 - Listeria innocua listeriocin 743A.

The pattern  we  developed  for  the  class  IIa bacteriocin family covers the
'pediocin box' motif.

-Conserved pattern: Y-G-N-G-[VL]-x-C-x(4)-C
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
