* Glycosyl hydrolases family 39 putative active site *
******************************************************

It has  been  shown  [1,E1]  that  the  following  glycosyl  hydrolases can be
classified into a single family on the basis of sequence similarities:

 - Mammalian lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase (EC 3.2.1.76).
 - Caldocellum  saccharolyticum  and  Thermoanaerobacter saccharolyticum beta-
   xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37) (gene xynB).

The best  conserved  regions  in  these  enzymes is  located in the N-terminal
section. It   contains  a  glutamic  acid  residue  which,  on  the  basis  of
similarities with other  families of glycosyl hydrolases [2], probably acts as
the proton donor in the catalytic mechanism. We use this region as a signature
pattern.

-Consensus pattern: W-x-F-E-x-W-N-E-P-[DN]
                    [The second E may be the active site residue]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
