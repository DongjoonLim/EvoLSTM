**********************************************
* Protozoan/cyanobacterial globins signature *
**********************************************

Globins are heme-containing  proteins involved in  binding and/or transporting
oxygen [1]. Almost all globins belong to a large family (see <PDOC00793>), the
only exceptions  are  the  following proteins which form a family of their own
[2,3,4]:

 - Monomeric  hemoglobins  from the protozoan Paramecium caudatum, Tetrahymena
   pyriformis and Tetrahymena thermophila.
 - Cyanoglobins  from  the  cyanobacteria Nostoc commune and Synechocystis PCC
   6803.
 - Globins  LI637  and  LI410  from  the chloroplast of the alga Chlamydomonas
   eugametos.
 - Mycobacterium tuberculosis globins glbN and glbO.

These proteins  contain a conserved histidine which could be involved in heme-
binding. As a signature pattern, we use a conserved region that ends with this
residue.

-Consensus pattern: F-[LF]-x(4)-[GE]-G-[PAT]-x(2)-[YW]-x-[GSE]-[KRQAE]-x(1,5)-
                    [LIVM]-x(3)-H
                    [The H may be a heme ligand]
-Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
-Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
-Last update: April 2006 / Pattern revised.
