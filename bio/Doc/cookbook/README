This is a directory to hold "cookbook" style documentation -- small,
single-purpose documents that describe a particular aspect of
Biopython. This is meant as an alternative to the large Tutorial
style documentation which can be daunting to maintain and keep up
to date.

Since these are all independent -- they can be written in any
style you find convenient, as long as it can be used to produce
something displayable on the web (HTML or PDF).

We welcome contributions about any aspect of Biopython. Please feel
free to discuss on our mailing list (biopython@biopython.org).
